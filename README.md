## This is only one out of the many releases we have to offer, we will have more stuff soon, take a look!

This is the same gui that used in all of whiz's videos, one of the most powerful guis to ever exist on site-19!

To the people that think we left site-19 because there was no more fun left to have, 
you are wrong, we left site-19 in favor of the roblox remote code execution vulnerability...
	
Site-19 currently is ran by the most croupt individuals, and will manipulate you just for their gain.
Sadly, I was fooled, my kindness was taken advantage of, resulting in the most critical vulnerabilities being gaven out in patched.
	
Including the open all doors exploit that wrecked havoc in febuary of 2025
although we weren't the first ones to find it.
	
We will not be naming the people that found the open all doors exploit first,
but we have the most up most respect for them.
	
## Highlights
	
Stellar/Trishdevs is a sad person.
	
Also imaydanoz, just because you think you can aim good in a lego larp game doesn't make you some sort of superior higher hierarchy of a human, 
please stop being an asshole to other people, people like you in site-19 acted as a source of motivation.
	
Another shoutout goes to rqzdz_devs, your efforts on trying to get our gui were cute
it is honestly quite funny how you tried to catfish whiz for the gui, but better luck next time!
	
	
	
We'd also like to give thanks to the entire site-19 high command, 
you were our exact source of motivation, thank you for everything.
